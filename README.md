- Developed a video indexing system using entity, posture, face, and voice recognition for wrestling and fighting video content.
- Entities in videos are selected and their posture points for similar actions matched using Dynamic Time Warping for a movement based search engine.
- Utilized Mediapipe and Arcface for movement identification and Whisper for audio transcription.  
- Users have an interface for uploading, searching, and automatically naming video content.  
- ffmpeg for concatenating identified durations to create video content.  
- Integrated facial recognition with manual identification and cosine similarity for automatic labeling,  unknown faces are shown to users to match faces to names.
- Optimized the system to run on a small Digital Ocean droplet and two laptop CPUs, targeting minimal resource usage.
