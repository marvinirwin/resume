## Experience  

**Tech Lead, Genrait (November 2023 - Present)**  
- Spearheaded the development, code review, and deployment of an entire web platform for bioinformatics, overseeing all aspects of the software lifecycle.  
- Refactored a fragile, untyped JavaScript and misused Angular 2 backend into a modern React and TypeScript stack, preserving existing functionality while eliminating over 50% of dead code to improve maintainability.  
- Designed and implemented an event-based architecture using Minio events to synchronize real-time database tables with S3-compatible object stores (AWS S3, Minio, Wasabi), enabling accurate folder sizes and seamless copy operations in a user-facing file system.  
- Led a team of two junior developers, providing meticulous code reviews to ensure stability in a precarious codebase and mentoring them on best practices.  
- Introduced Cypress end-to-end testing, slashing production deployment times from one week to one day and removing the vast majority of manual testing.  
- Streamlined the database by deleting redundant tables and consolidating critical functionality, removing unused collections and dead code to enhance system efficiency.  
- Tackled significant refactoring challenges, such as maintaining feature parity in a brittle legacy system, by strategically prioritizing live code and validating changes with automated tests.  

**Learned Chinese in Taipei (2023)**  
- Lived in Taipei for the better part of a year full-time studying Mandarin at a cram school. Obtained about HSK-4 proficiency.  
- Learned to speak, read, and write (with Pinyin) standard Chinese, though all the things I read now are in Simplified, so I have mostly forgotten how to read Traditional.
